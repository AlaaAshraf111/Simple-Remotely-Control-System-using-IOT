# Simple-Remotely-Control-System-using-IOT
Our target is to design a medical App for measuring the percentage of oxygen in the blood. Based on that we operate the oxygen device remotely. 
### This operation consists of sub_processes as the following:
1. measure the percentage of oxygen using sensor Max 30100 
2. send readings and contact with the oxygen device using Wi-Fi 
3. use "Blynk" App of phones to interface remotely with the ventilator.
### components:
1. NodeMCU
2. Max 30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
3. Blynk App
